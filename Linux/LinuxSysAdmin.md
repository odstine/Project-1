1. Permissions on `/etc/shadow` should allow only `root` read and write access.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls- lah shadow

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): n/a

2. Permissions on `/etc/gshadow` should allow only `root` read and write access.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls- lah gshadow

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): n/a

3. Permissions on `/etc/group` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -lah group

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): n/a

4. Permissions on `/etc/passwd` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

### Step 2: Create User Accounts

1. Add user accounts for `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, `sara`, and `admin`.

    - Command to add each user account (include all five users): 
	+ sudo su
	+ sudo useradd sam joe amy sara admin

2. Ensure that only the `admin` has general sudo access.

    - Command to add `admin` to the `sudo` group: sudo usermod -G sudo admin

### Step 3: Create User Group and Collaborative Folder

1. Add an `engineers` group to the system.

    - Command to add group: sudo addgroup engineers

2. Add users `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, and `sara` to the managed group.

    - Command to add users to `engineers` group (include all four users):
	+ sudousermod -G engineers sam
	+ sudo usermod -G engineers joe
	+ sudo usermod -G engineers amy
	+ sudo usermod -G engineers sara
	+ sudo usermod -G engineers admin
	+ cat group [to double check that each person was in the engineers group.]

3. Create a shared folder for this group at `/home/engineers`.

    - Command to create the shared folder: sudo mkdir engineers

4. Change ownership on the new engineers' shared folder to the `engineers` group.

    - Command to change ownership of engineer's shared folder to engineer group:
	+ sudo chgrp -R engineers /home/engineers
	+ sudo chmod -R 2775 /home/engineers

### Step 4: Lynis Auditing

1. Command to install Lynis: [Follow Shivani in class]

	+ chmod +x lynis.system.sh
	+ sudo crontab -e
		- @daily lynis audit --tests-from-group malware, authentication >> /tmp/lynis_groups_scan.log
	+ 
		

2. Command to see documentation and instructions: man lynis

3. Command to run an audit: sudo lynis audit system

4. Provide a report from the Lynis output on what can be done to harden the system.

    - Screenshot of report output: Security scan came up with a Hardening Index of 56 suggestions. See them listed below. Cannot add screenshot to .txt file.
